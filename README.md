## “Street names are more than just navigational tools; they're memories etched into our neighborhoods.”

#### Project Summary
This project explores gender representation in Amsterdam's street names. Using PostGIS within PostgreSQL for spatial analysis and GeoPandas for additional calculations in Python, I categorized street names by gender, plants, places, object, animals and other. The analysis measured both the total number and length of streets associated with each classification in Amsterdam.
