#### This project explores gender representation in Amsterdam's street names. Using PostGIS within PostgreSQL for spatial analysis and GeoPandas for additional calculations in Python, I categorized street names by gender and object. The analysis measured both the total number and length of streets associated with each gender. A visualized map of these findings offers insights into the prevalence and spatial distribution of different naming conventions.
